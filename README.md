A curated collection of AI for Compiler research papers, covering topics like **auto-tuning**, **code optimization**, **representation learning**, and **compiler architecture**. This repository automatically converts BibTeX entries into Markdown and JSON, then generates an interactive static website with search, filtering, and visual analytics.

> 🚧 This website is still under construction! We’re working to collect a broad range of high-quality papers to fill current gaps.
